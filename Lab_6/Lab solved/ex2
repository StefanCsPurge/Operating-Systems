Explica»õi efectul produs de:

execlp("ls", "ls", "*.c", NULL);

This first searches for "ls" program in the PATH ( p ) then executes it by overriding the current process (the unexpected behaviour).
The parameters are passed as a comma delimited enumeration ( l ) terminated by NULL.

So, it executed the command "ls *.c", which shows all the files whose names  end with ".c" from the current directory.
