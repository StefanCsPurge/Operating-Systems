Implement a program that involves text and binary file I/O and memory allocation

Consider a text file storing a matrix as follows: the numbers of rows and columns are on the first line separated by space, and on the subsequent lines, are the elements of the matrix separated by space.
    Read a matrix of integers from a text file and display to it in the console
    Store the matrix in a binary file. open(), read(), write(), write(), fscanf(), close()
    Verify the binary file generated by the program by displaying it in the console using command xxd m.bin
    Load the matrix form the binary file and display it in the console.open(), read(), write(), write(), fscanf(), close()
