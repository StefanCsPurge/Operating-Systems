cat last.fake | grep "^t" | awk '$2 ~ /pts\/9/{print $1}'


8. Find all the distinct usernames starting with "r" that are currently running programs, and display them duplicating every vowel 

cat ps.fake | grep "^r" | sort -k 1,1 -u | cut -d ' ' -f1 | sed 's/\([aeiou]\)/\1\1/g'


9. Display all the distinct lines left in /etc/passwd after deleting all letter and digits and spaces

sed 's/[^r]//g' passwd | sed '/^\s*$/d' | sort | uniq


11. Calculate the average of the PIDs of the processes currently running in the system

cat ps.fake | awk 'BEGIN {n;s} NF>=2{s+=$2; n++} END{print s/n}'

or

cat ps.fake | awk 'NF>=2{s+=$2; n++} END{print s/n}'
